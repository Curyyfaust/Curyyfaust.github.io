# About Me

Here is **Chenghan Li (李承汉)**.

I am a junior student studying in the Zhejiang University and UIUC major in Electrical Engineering([**ZJU-UIUC**](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/)),  in China,supervised by Prof. [**Ruisheng Diao**](https://person.zju.edu.cn/H121050#0). I am also an incoming PhD student at Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. Ye Guo.

## Research Interests

My research interests are **AI for Electricity** .It employs AI techniques to enhance applications such as prediction, fault detection, and scheduling in electrical systems.At the same time i am also interested in applying the AI and I am interested in applying AI and economic approaches to future energy planning and climate transition research.

Prior to this, I have also been exposed to AI4science **biology, environmental science, materials and medicine**.,traffic flow forecasting and other research areas.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *chenghan.20@intl.zju.edu.cn*.
