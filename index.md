# About Me

&emsp;&emsp;Here is **Songning Lai (赖颂宁)**.

&emsp;&emsp;I am a junior student studying in the School of Information Science and Engineering(**Chongxin College**), Shandong University in China. Here is my Resume (Resume to be completed, please look forward to).

## Research Interests

&emsp;&emsp;My current research focuses on practical problems that artificial intelligence faces in real-life applications. Specifically, I am interested in **Deep Learning** and **its potential applications in other fields**. I believe that advanced technologies like DL and those that intersect with DL can have a positive impact on society as a whole. I am committed to using my talents to contribute to this meaningful cause and bring benefits to society.

&emsp;&emsp;In my research, I have explored various fields, including **bioinformatics** (such as predicting protein post-translational modification sites, single-cell transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and medical imaging), **multimodal sentiment analysis**, **domain generalization**, and **the interpretability of multimodal models**.
