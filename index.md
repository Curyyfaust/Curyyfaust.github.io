# About Me

Here is **Songning Lai (赖颂宁)**.

I am a junior student studying in the School of Information Science and Engineering([**Chongxin Xuetang**](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%9C%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E5%B4%87%E6%96%B0%E5%AD%A6%E5%A0%82/20809738?fr=aladdin)), [**Shandong University**](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in China. Here is my [**Resume**](/file/CV_SongningLai_.pdf).

## Research Interests

My current research focuses on practical problems that artificial intelligence faces in real-life applications. Specifically, I am interested in **Deep Learning** and **its potential applications in other fields**. I believe that advanced technologies like DL and those that intersect with DL can have a positive impact on society as a whole. I am committed to using my talents to contribute to this meaningful cause and bring benefits to society.

In my research, I have explored various fields, including **bioinformatics** (such as predicting protein post-translational modification sites, single-cell transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and medical imaging), **multimodal sentiment analysis**, **domain generalization**, and **the interpretability of multimodal models**.
