# About Me

Here is **Chenghan Li (李承汉)**.

I am a junior student studying in the Zhejiang University and UIUC major in Electrical Engineering([**ZJU-UIUC**](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/)),  in China,supervised by Prof. [**Ruisheng Diao**](https://person.zju.edu.cn/H121050#0). I am also an incoming PhD student at Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. Ye Guo.

## Research Interests

My research interests are **Explainable AI (XAI)** and **Privacy-preserving AI**. Specifically, my research goal is to build faithful XAI systems which are easily understood by users and are robust in various environments (e.g. **XAI4LLM, XAI4NLP, XAI4MM, XAI4CV, XAI4Security** and so on). I am also interested in applying the XAI to real-world scenarios (e.g. optical systems, recommender systems, and traffic forecasting etc.). At the same time, I am also very interested in the research of AI in the field of **astronomy, environmental science, materials and medicine**.

Prior to this, I have also been exposed to bioinformatics, multimodal sentiment analysis, domain generalization and other research areas.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *sonly[at]mail[dot]sdu[dot]edu[dot]cn*.
