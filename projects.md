- We propose a novel and efficient computational method, BERT\_PLPS, to predict lysine phosphoglycerylation sites.

- The dynamic masking strategy is used to replace the original static masking strategy, which effectively improves the anti-noise ability of the model.

- Several groups of experiments are designed to compare and explore the adaptability of various data dimensionality reduction algorithms for amino acid sequence task learning.

- Experiments on the public benchmark data sets verify the feasibility of the model. Moreover, our current approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

- We propose a function based on the covariance matrix as a second-order statistic to measure the distribution of features between aligned and drawn-out modes.

- We design a differentiable loss function to train the network to learn shared information between modalities.

- We use a self-supervised learning strategy generation module to guide the multimodal task to focus on modality-specific private information.

- We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets for multimodal sentiment analysis to validate the feasibility of our designed module. Our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

-This article proposes a new training model to solve this problem through NLP processing methods. We first propose a Crime Fact Data Preprocessing Module (CFDPM), which can balance the defects of uneven data set distribution by generating new samples. Then we use a large open source dataset (CAIL-big) as our pretraining dataset and a small dataset collected by ourselves for Fine-tuning, giving it good generalization ability to unfamiliar small datasets. At the same time, we use the improved Bert model with dynamic masking to improve the model. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the present dataset. At the same time, the effectiveness of module CFDPM is proved by experiments. This article provides a valuable methodology contribution for classifying social science texts such as criminal behaviors. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves new stateof-the-art results.

- For moving targets, a structured illumination is used for structured light encoding, and multiple iterative correlations are performed for the motion of the target under static pseudorandom light patterns. By using the temporal amplitude signals collected by a single-pixel detector and known projection light patterns, clear images can be reconstructed. In traditional optical field modulation, structured light modulation is usually applied to objects to achieve light encoding. Regardless of using orthogonal or non-orthogonal bases for object encoding, the projected structured light pattern is often composed of square pixel blocks. In the new approach, when the square pixel blocks are mapped to a circular area, the shape of the pixels changes, and the sizes of the inner and outer pixels are different. Therefore, when reconstructing the image, it is necessary to remap the reconstructed image to the corresponding area of the mask according to the same principle, so that the solved object corresponds to the real object information.

- After the gas is released, the light intensity value slightly increases, with a very small change range, which is of the same order of magnitude as the noise. Since the mass number of CH4 (16) is smaller than that of N2 (28), increasing the gas concentration to 5% and collecting it using the downward emptying air method results in a concentration lower than the standard value, and the rough absorption is about 3% (according to the Beer-Lambert Law, the optical path is small under experimental conditions, and the absorption value is not large).
- The detection and identification of methane are achieved by utilizing its absorption characteristics in the infrared spectrum region. Except for using a Fourier transform spectrometer, all other methods require additional illumination of the field of view. Furthermore, the half-width of the light source needs to be narrow enough (of the same order of magnitude as the half-width of the methane absorption peak, about 0.05nm) and the center wavelength needs to match the methane absorption peak.
